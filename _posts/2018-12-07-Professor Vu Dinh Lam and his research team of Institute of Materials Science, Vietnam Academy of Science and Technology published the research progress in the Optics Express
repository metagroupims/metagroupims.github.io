summary:    The research team leads by Professor Vu Dinh Lam, Institute of Materials Science, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology published their innovative research achievement titled “Conductive polymer for ultra-broadband, wide-angle, and polarization-insensitive metamaterial perfect absorber” in Optics Express, a journal under the OSA Publishing.
This study has demonstrated a broadband metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) using a new material-the conductive polymer. This result is very interesting as a simple ring structure can create a broadband absorption in the microwave band. By optimizing the electrical conductivity of the polymer, a 16.7 GHz broadband MPA is observed with the absorptivity greater than 80% for both transverse magnetic and electric polarization. The work contributes to further studies on broadband MPA. It is also of great significance for the development of various applications.
