## Current research topics

### - Taming Materials

The overall aim of this proposal is first to fabricate static metamaterials operating at least at THz frequencies, but possibility even extending into the mid- and near-infrared and to minimize the loss processes in these. In addition, the attention of this project will focus on achieving tunable dynamic control of metamaterials by incorporating optically and/or electronically, thermally active materials into the metamaterial structure. In summary, this project has the following objectives:

1. Design and fabrication of controllable planar metamaterials operating at THz frequencies and higher.
2. Understanding and reducing electromagnetic losses in metamaterials. Realization of metamaterials which can actively be controlled.

### - Plasmonic Hybridization in Metamaterials

A simple but general mechanism is introduced to realize the dual magnetic resonance exhibiting a broadband negative permeability. A satisfactory explanation, based on the second-order hybridization of symmetric metamaterials, for resonant splitting is given. It is manifested that the geometric correlation plays a vital role in controlling the hybridization strength. Transfer matrix simulations and equivalent circuit model analysis are performed to corroborate our idea. In the left Figure, the transmission evolution of second-ordered hybridized CWP metamaterials according to lattice constant in the k direction a(z).

### - Electromagnetic Behavior of Combined Metamaterials
Lately, a simple combined structure, consisting of a periodic array of cut-wire pairs .CWPs. and continuous wires, was proposed and received extensive attention when the NRI was successfully obtained. On the other hand, a CWP structure, which is a pair of aligned metal bars separated by a dielectric spacer, has distinct advantages over the conventional SRRs and, hence, has potential to obtain NRI at optical wavelengths. As well understood in a combined structure, the negative . is produced by both plasma of the continuous wires and electric resonance of the CWP while the negative . solely comes from the magnetic resonance of CWP. On the left Figure, geometry of the unit cell of combined structure is viewed from the E-H, the E-k, and the k-H plane. In which ax, ay, and az are the size of the unit cell in x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively. However, the characteristics of NRI still have not been completely understood. In this topic, by the experimental and numerical studies, one can elucidate the essence of NRI behavior of the combined structure. The effective permittivity and permeability can also calculated from the complex scattering parameters using the standard retrieval procedure.

### - Metamaterials-based Microwave "Dark Body"
The meaning of "dark body" is to maximize the material absorption. Recently, the great potential of perfect absorber metamaterials has been confirmed in the research where a near unity of absorption was observed for the first time in a microwave metamaterial. The basic idea is to minimize the transmission and to simultaneously minimize the reflection though impedance matching technique. It is clear but not simple to handle with natural materials. In case of a metamaterial absorber, the loss is controllable by dispersion permitivity and permeability, where the impedance matching occurs. By using artificial resonators, we show that the absorption magnitude and the frequency can be programed.
