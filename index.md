# Welcome to IMS Metamaterial Group

<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"> Metamaterials are artificial materials, consisting of periodic man-made structures. An electromagnetic metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves by having structural features smaller than the wavelength of the respective electromagnetic wave. In addition, if a metamaterial behaves as a homogeneous material accurately described by the effective parameters, its features must be much smaller than the wavelength. To date, metamaterials have become a new sub-discipline within electromagnetism, optics, and photonics.
